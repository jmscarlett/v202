title: DiscoBAX - Discovery of optimal intervention sets in genomic experiment design
openreview: kEnDJdTM9A
abstract: The discovery of therapeutics to treat genetically-driven pathologies relies
  on identifying genes involved in the underlying disease mechanism. Existing approaches
  search over the billions of potential interventions to maximize the expected influence
  on the target phenotype. However, to reduce the risk of failure in future stages
  of trials, practical experiment design aims to find a set of interventions that
  maximally change a target phenotype via diverse mechanisms. We propose DiscoBAX
  - a sample-efficient method for maximizing the rate of significant discoveries per
  experiment while simultaneously probing for a wide range of diverse mechanisms during
  a genomic experiment campaign. We provide theoretical guarantees of optimality under
  standard assumptions, and conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation covering
  both synthetic as well as real-world experimental design tasks. DiscoBAX outperforms
  existing state-of-the-art methods for experimental design, selecting effective and
  diverse perturbations in biological systems.
