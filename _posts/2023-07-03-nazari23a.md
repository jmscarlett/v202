title: Geometric Autoencoders - What You See is What You Decode
openreview: VAEZ4nrqAk
abstract: Visualization is a crucial step in exploratory data analysis. One possible
  approach is to train an autoencoder with low-dimensional latent space. Large network
  depth and width can help unfolding the data. However, such expressive networks can
  achieve low reconstruction error even when the latent representation is distorted.
  To avoid such misleading visualizations, we propose first a differential geometric
  perspective on the decoder, leading to insightful diagnostics for an embedding’s
  distortion, and second a new regularizer mitigating such distortion. Our “Geometric
  Autoencoder” avoids stretching the embedding spuriously, so that the visualization
  captures the data structure more faithfully. It also flags areas where little distortion
  could not be achieved, thus guarding against misinterpretation.
